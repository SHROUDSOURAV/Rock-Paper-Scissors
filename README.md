## 🧠 How It Works

- The player clicks on one of the three options: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
- The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
- Game logic determines the winner:
  - Rock crushes Scissors  
  - Scissors cuts Paper  
  - Paper covers Rock
- A real-time score is updated for the player and computer.
- A dynamic message box gives instant feedback:
  - **Win**, **Lose**, or **Draw** – each styled uniquely with animations and colors.
